                Snakes and ladders has a long history. The earliest known version of the game was found in India, where it was called Moksha Patam. The game was played on a 10x10 board with 100 squares. The game was played with cowrie shells, and the player who reached the 100th square first won the game. The game was played by the Indian royalty, and was later introduced to the rest of the world by the British.
